# Strategic Context

Providing a strategic context enables all people on the product team to exercise [[ownership]]

A strategic context is the 'why' of your business. That 'why' better be 'to solve x problem' and be tightly coupled with a [[product vision]], of what the world looks like when your problem is solved.

When making an actual [[focused strategy]], a maker needs to account for the product vision, Health Indicators [[Business KPIs]], and details of the customer and enabling technologies.
