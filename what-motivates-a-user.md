# What Motivates a User

Any human needs a reason for doing a thing. That reason does not have to be concious, nor does it have to be intuitive.

There are basically two starting conditions:
- Human is aware of a problem
- Human is unaware of a problem

## Aware

Once a human knows they have a problem (e.g. through the course of business or life) they will decide to do something about it or not.

This decision is not always concious.

An doctor knows they need to operate on a patient, somewhere underneath the surface of their skin. A good doctor might try to use a tool to create an incision; a bad doctor might try to rip one open with their nails. At this point, the doctor will probably use a scalpel, but they might consider other ways of cutting like a laser. But they might also consider not cutting at all, and instead using a more advanced tool to perform keyhole surgery.

That same doctor knows that their job is stressful and at the end of the day, they want to relax. That doctor might take a relaxing bath or mediate. They might also work out, thinking they are solving a fitness problem but also inadvertently solving a stress problem. Or they might dig into their collection of single-malt whiskys, claiming they just like the taste but somehow never going a night without having three drams.

## Unaware

Some humans might not know they have a problem. This results in a more circuitous decision to solve it, and usually requires:
- A product they are already using to surprise them with a solution; or
- For someone to tell them about the problem

If the good doctor is using scheduling software to book their appointments, they might be surprised and delighted to find that the scheduling software one day surfaces analytics on the surgeries they are performing and warning them that they are accidentally clustering extremely difficult surgeries at the end of the day, contributing to their stress.

On the other hand, they might be unaware that their handwriting is terrible, resulting in patients not getting correct medication, leading to re-admissions. In this case, an enterprising peddler might make them aware that other doctors have the same problem and suggest dictation software.
