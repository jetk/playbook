# Customer Discovery

## When

If you're unsure that you're building something people want

## Why

If you're not sure you have a problem and you're not sure you have a customer, you are probably wasting resources.

## General thoughts

- Problems define your customers. Specifically, they unite your customers.
- A key way to understand your customer's problems is to step into their workflow.
  - A workflow is anything someone is trying to acheive. This can be more or less defined
  - This can be defined in Gherkin: Given a person has these conditions, when they do X, Y doesn't happen (or happen well)
- Customers may not understand their problems, so you may have to step out of their processes
- **This is not about solutions. If you focus on finding customers who want solutions, you'll end up with horses on steroids**

## General approach

- Diverge, observe and pay attention to broad strokes
- Document at least 6 cases where you see a repeated problem
- Converge on specific hypothesese (this thing / no-thing is a problem because it stops you from doing / not-doing)
- Confirm (get out of the building)
