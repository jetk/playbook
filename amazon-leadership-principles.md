# Amazon Leadership Principles

These will apply to greater or lesser degree in relationship to the act of making a product.

They are roughly ranked in frequency. Ownership is last because it's always important.

Most critical LPs for Amazon PMs are bolded; however I chose this order as they apply to the doing of product, rather than the working as a product manager.

## ALPs

1. **[[Customer Obsession]]**
2. **Dive Deep**
3. [[Invent and Simplify]]
4. **[[Bias for Action]]**
5. Deliver Results
6. [[Think Big]]
7. Learn and be Curious
8. Frugality
9. Insist on the highest standards
10. **Earn Trust**
11. [[Are Right, A Lot]]
12. Have Backbone, Disagree and Commit
13. Hire and develop the best
14. **[[Ownership]]**
