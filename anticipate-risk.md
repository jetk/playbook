# Anticipate Risk

Marty Cagan lists four types of risk that can sink a product. At the Discovery Phase, it's tempting to focus on Demand Risk. But that's just a great way of finding out after you build something that it's unusable, technically unfeasible, and harmful to your business.

## When

As soon as you have new information, but at least when you believe you've discovered a problem and customers for a solution to that problem.

## Why

If you haven't gone through the exercise, you'll almost definitely get blindsided somewhere down the line. It could cost you time, it could cost you the product or even the business. Take 5 minutes to make sure you can build and sell something people want and can use.

Btw, this is a separate validation to whether something actually solves the problem. That takes a much more careful user journey mapping, aka [[Work Backwards]]
