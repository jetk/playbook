# Find a Problem

Problem discovery goes hand-in-hand with customer discovery and together they form the foundation of product discovery.

In this domain, a problem is anything **valuable** that a **user** can't do because:

- It's possible but not without a lot of set-up/resources
- It's been hitherto technologically impossible
- It's been hitherto very bureaucratic or required a lot of legal/official interaction
- It's too expensive or unavailable at an affordable initial outlay
- It takes too long
- It's not fun or engaging

A problem is solvable if you can deliver the value a user wants. Value is anything that a user wants enough to try bad products as a way of getting. Eventually they'll try your good product.

# When

Usually when you come up with a half-baked product idea, it's a good idea to step back and actually work out what the problem really is.
