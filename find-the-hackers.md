# Find the Hackers

An expanded case of [[Your Own Itch]]. There are people who know they have a problem and have built a crappy solution (which they may or may not be invested in) that's probably failing at solving the problem

These are much easier to go after and learn from than people who don't know they have a problem.

But also don't get sucked into their solution, just understand where it's leaving their skin raw and why the itch keeps coming back.
