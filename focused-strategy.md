# Focused Strategy

The difference between prioritization and focus is that one leaves you with an order of doing things, the other will have maximal impact.

Don't let what is possible get in the way of what is useful. If you are optimizing performance across a codebase, don't make little efficiency gains here and there, step back and find the bottlenecks and clear those first.

From sifting through reams of data, considering the [[strategic context]] (which contains the [[product vision]] but also the realities of running a business, feasabilities of technologies and market conditions), focus on the **most** effective next steps. And chain step after step together on effectiveness or impact.
