# Price

A market is sized around the customer's willingness to pay to not have a problem. That's it
Remember it's a demand curve. This means price elasticity of demand matters. This means demand elasticity is probably not linear. This means you can plot a profit maximising point. Shit, remember your econ

Remember price elasticity will change due to external shocks, and the effects of there being more information in the market. Eventually it will become a convex right angle as the market commoditises

Four steps, stolen from THRV:

1. Define the jobs to be done, and get ratings on how hard the entire market finds it to do these jobs
2. Cluster (k-means or otherwise) respondents by those with a common, hard, problem
    a. By this, we mean for tasks 1-10, look for which tasks have a tight cluster of 'very hards'
3. Query price-to-get-job-done for the jobs that define each cluster
    a. By this, foreach job, for the customers who all had a given job that are very hard, ask them how much they'd pay to have the problem solved
4. Target the most underserved segment that has the most people willing to pay a lot for problem solved
