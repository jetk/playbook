# AARRR

Coined by Dave McClure. [OG slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version/2-Customer_Lifecycle_5_Steps_to) here and [detailed writeup here](https://producttribe.com/revenue-amp-growth/aarrr-framework-best-guide)

Very useful, but also more for when you're thinking about your product as supporting a business (which it always should, but only after it solves a problem).

## When

These should be implemented by default at the start of most relevant products.

## Why

AARRR (Acquire, Activate, Retain, Refer, Revenue) basically describes the whole customer *lifecycle* but not the detailed customer *journey*. This means AARRR should be wrapped around [[customer success metrics]] to tell you if your business is working. Note: often your business is not working because your product isn't, but sometimes it's for another reason

## General thoughts

- Since these range from top of the funnel to revenue and referral, these apply less to, e.g. sales-driven products (eh they exist) and also to products where individual users are not making (or driving) purchase decisions.
- You might not have control over each stage of the funnel (e.g. you might not be in charge of acquisition) but you can still use the metrics to inform the decisions you do have control over
- Do not get lost in these. It can become very hard to see the wood for the trees at 5 steps and multiple metrics per step. Try to keep journey metrics in a [[metrics flow]]
- AARRRs are full of bullshit metrics, and you should [[avoid bullshit metrics]] because optimising for the wrong (read: narrow-minded and harmful to other parts of the product/funnel) metric is worse than not optimising at all.

## General approach

- Acquisition: At this stage you're basically doing marketing. Don't necessarily leave this to the pros, but rely on the proven tactics to get qualified traffic. I'm a 1,000 true fans type of guy, but sometimes you gotta growth hack (sigh)
- Activation: As a PM, this is the start of your wheelhouse. Figure out a way to track time-to-magic, and relentlessly optimise. This is close to a customer success metric, but really focuses on the first part: does the user even get what value is in store for them? Typically, this is *done* by demonstrating vale early, and *measured* by how many make it through onboarding. Again, onboarding should demonstrate value really fucking soon or you're doing it working.
- Retention: This is after your customer has succeeded once, typically (otherwise, you're basically asking them to bash their head against your product on faith). Beware: someone that's forced to use your app often because you suck at tateful automation isn't going to stick around in the long run, so pick what you measure accordingly.
- Referral: If your product solves something well, people are going to want their friends on it because *they like their friends and want their problems solved too*. Sure, incentivising referral is a bit of a dark art sometimes, but basically, focus on measuring genuine referral, rather than pay-for-play.
- Revenue: Important if you're a business. Also a sign that your product is solving a problem. Also a huge source of bullshit metrics, and a really easy way to lose sight of long-term health (high revenue low retention low referral means you're not a business, you're an ad spend incinerator)

## Specific tactics

### Acquisition

- Channel-specific ad metrics (CTR, CPM, CPI, CPA, CAC, CPL, Bounce, etc.)
- Inbound search tracking
- Internal search tracking
- Direct link tracking

### Activation

- Action tracking on the onboarding journey
- Source tracking on completed onboarding
- Action tracking on value post-onboarding

### Retention

- Chuuuuuuuuurn
- CLV/LTV deltas
- Deltas on pretty much any reasonable revenue metrics

### Referral

- Share per person
- Total shares
- Couponing/bonus uptake

### Revenue

- Most reasonable metrics like ARPU, LTC/CAC, ROI, if you're being sensible
- Revenue per feature
- Revenue per source/channel
