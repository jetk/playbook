# Customer Success Metrics

Product Metrics (North Stars Scenarios) must come after Customer Metrics

## When

Before any development is done, and usually before any design is even done.

From a technical standpoint, metrics must be embedded from day one; these are hard to retrofit into code and impossible to retrofit into process

## Why

Product work should not go ahead until we've worked out how to measure if *any* solution we design is doing its job. Otherwise, there will be no means of evaluating product success which means any possiblity of improvement is a shot in the dark.

## General thoughts

- Customer metrics should reflect abstract outcomes, rather than concrete ways in which those outcomes are reached
- This does run close to a [[North Star Scenario]] but is different because it doesn't presuppose a solution
- It is fine if it takes a long time to determine the best metrics

## General approach

- Customer metrics become the forcing function of further development, i.e. you should be blocked on doing work until you have metrics determined
- Remember you are measuring the customer's outcome in this circumstance, so if your customer's problem is liquidity, a good metric is money borrowed
- These are impact-level metrics, and should correlated with outcome-level metrics (which you need a solution to measure)
- Do not confuse these with [[AARRR]] which are helpful but much more granular (in practice; the theory's good but if you're actually implementing any AARRRs they will go into a functioning product)

## Specific tactics

- Action tracking
