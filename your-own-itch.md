# Your Own Itch

Be extremely careful becuase if you are in any way imaginative, you'll always focus on the scratch, not the itch. Scratching an itch is terrible idea.

Figuring out that the itch is causing you discomfort and making you want to scrape at it with your nails is pure gold, because you realised that the problem you're solving is continued itching.

So you come up with a solution that stops the itching without tearing at your skin until it's bloody and raw.

## When

You have identified a problem, usually by an instinctive half-baked solution you come up halfway through dealing with the problem, which tends to distract from the problem.

## Why

You are extremely capabale of spotting problems. You just need discipline to stay focused on the problem instead of falling in love with the solution.
