# Segment

Segmentation is pretty important at every phase but most crucial at the discover and define stage
It is an intensification of customer discovery, and also may lead to insights on whether your market exists at all

Being blunt, it  prevents you from:

- designing for everybody (I.e. Nobody)
- failing to troubleshoot when measuring

## When

After you've done [[customer discovery]], when picking designs, and when measuring success and failure.

## Why

If you're not confident that several meaningful customer cohorts exist, they probably do.

Defining segments allows you to design real solutions

Analysing by segments will possibly get you answers faster on why something is going wrong, as well as potentially leading to further product insights.

## General thoughts

- Segmentation needs to be meaningful and relevant. Using the wrong Segmentation at the wrong time can be really as bad as using the wrong metrics 
- This means you should focus your segments on what you're trying to understand and what you're trying to achieve
- However, understanding everything about the demographic and psychographic is only a precursor to understanding that segment's job's to be done

## General Approach

- Pick segments that are relevant to your problem: if it's "we want a social network that isn't full of boomers" then Age is probably a granted, but you'll want more resolution 
- Don't forget that segments nest and overlap
- Design segments are different to business segments are different to troubleshooting segments 
- Segments form logical grouping of features that combine to solve a problem. Ignore them at your own peril. Remember the swimming pool with starting blocks, ping pong table and lounge chairs, but no swimlanes or concession stand, thereby disappointing both pro swimmers and leisure swimmers
- Tend to start off by segmenting "how hard is this problem for you"
- Tend to end by segmenting "how well does this work for you"
- Business segmentation is useful for price discrimination, if you're into that
- Understand that the beneficiary, the executor and the purchaser are sometimes different people (TODO, lift and shift into Customer Discovery)

## Specific Tactics

- Focus on grouping users by task/need before anything, also called [[jobs to be done]]
- Situational tends to inform need and therefore design. Everyone who vapes doesn't necessarily vape on the go, but those who vape on the go need a portable vape
- Demographic grouping is pretty BS unless demographics somehow have similar needs (maybe age/pregnancy medication?)
- Psychographic / behavioural can be used to design multiple UX flows or copy around the same functionality. But don't do psychographic segmentation unless it lets you separate needs
- Geographic grouping tends to highlight cultural or regulatory requirements
- Scale (if B2B) will highlight difference in sophistication, integration and UX â€“ larger orgs will have more specialised users, smaller ones will probably have single or few users doing the whole task
- Sample insights from individuals and then test to see if these insights are repeated (TODO, fancy term and article)
