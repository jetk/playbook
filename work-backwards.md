# Work Backwards

Find an outcome that benefits your customer: 'Talked to a friend'

## When

When designing solutions, and being really sure about them before you build.

## Why

Working backwards allows you to immediately grok that there are a lot of ways to solve a given problem and build the best one, instead of picking a solution and trying to fit it to the problem.

## General thoughts

- This also serves as a crucial validation point of your solution.

## General approach

- Start with an outcome that can be described in a few short phrases
- This outcome, when enabled by something you build, is your [[product vision]]
- Be really clear on the benefits of this outcome
- Work out a way of measuring how well any solution can achieve this outcome
- Prioritise the highest impact one you can achieve
- Be aware that sometimes the best approach might take longer. If so, work to validate it quickly and ship iteratively
