# Mindset

## Why?

The attitude or mindset you have as a product manager is the key determining factor to whether this playbook will work for you. Without them, it becomes a manual for building a cargo-cult magical thinking.

If you are going to do this right, you have to understand: Why Do Product Management.

Remember: the playbook can change. The rules can change. Right now, these are the best rules for doing the following: Identify a problem that really needs solving, design a usable, feasible, viable solution, deliver and spread it, measure its success and live to solve another problem. For now, that's why you're doing PM, in **this set of ways**.


### Solo / Greenfield

If you're just starting on something, stop. 'Something' implies you had a cool idea for a product and are trying to figure out how to build it. The more you do so, the more you fall in love with your product.

**Fall in love with a problem instead**. Products are nothing, just a means to an end, and that end is a solved problem. And make sure it's actually worth solving.

Products should be ephemeral, the best solution to a problem for their times. I repeat: the best product makers will routinely destroy old products, because they have found a product that better solves the problem. It's only called 'disruption' because many businesses are built around solving some problem with a particular product; a **better product disrupts a business**, not a problem.

If you're not sure what that problem is, you are lost. Once you are sure (and there are many ways to be sure), then you can actually do product management: build the best thing possible (technically, legally, culturally) that solves the problem you're sure needs solving. And make sure you can run a business around it, if you want to. Products without markets (i.e. people that need solutions) are not products. However, products without a revenue source can be great charity projects.

So to boil it down to one phrase: Everything you do is in service of defining a **valuable** problem and delivering a solution to it.
