# Jobs to Be Done

I won't spend too much time rehashing something that's well covered [here](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done), [there](https://www.thrv.com/jobs-to-be-done) and [everywhere](https://jtbd.info/know-the-two-very-different-interpretations-of-jobs-to-be-done-5a18b748bd89)

But I will point out a few things:
- Thinking in JTBD usually takes you one or two orders below the surface; e.g. streaming music > hearing music > creating a certain feeling
- There are different levels of [goals](https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*EJJF0hAmRjhcvVOIguZ-Qw.jpeg) according to Willaim Powers
- Jobs-as-progress is when someone hires a product to go from current to ideal state. These are 'Being' goals in Powers terms, and whilst incredibly important, don't provide much resolution on a solution ("Be succesful as a music venue" goes down to "have more revenue than costs" and below that you're looking at "have sold-out shows")
- Jobs-as-activity is when someone hires a product to do an activity better (kinda a BS distinction but it apparently exists; really the activity is subordinate to the progress/outcome)
- Support an entire workflow, consider Norman's Action Model (Goal, Plan, Specify, Perform, Perceive, Interpret, Compare-to-goal)
