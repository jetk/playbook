# North Star Scenario

Once you actually have a problem to solve and the beginning of a solution, do you come up with a NSS.

You need to trust that you've done the discovery work right, or else this might abstract away the crucial act of finding a great problem.

Once you do have a great problem, a NSS is a behavior statement that would define success of your product.

If customer metrics are "Is my customer solving their problem", NSS metrics are "does my product solve the problem for the customer in the way I've designed"

The success of your product should be 100% in service to the success of your users.

Define a scenario and make all product decisions in service of maximising the repetition of that scenario
