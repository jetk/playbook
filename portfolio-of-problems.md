# Portfolio of Problems

A map of problem clusters that entails everything that is stopping your user from succeeding at something you've decided to solve for them. Not ordered in terms of priority (that's what a backlog is for) so that you can see problems in conceptual groups and keep user journey steps in order.

A useful parallel to the classic backlog. A good tool for starting out, and for quickly mapping your hyperspace jumps to achieve a realised prouct vision.

## When

When exploring a new user persona or solving a new set of problems for an existing user. Typically useful if you've nailed one B2B problem a customer has and they ask you "er, so there's a whole bunch of other stuff we need to do to run our business and our other software is shite"

## Why

It comes down to structure. All of these problems should be encapsulated by your backlog (eventually), however it becomes useful to be able to not consider everything in terms of linear priority. User life is multi-threaded, so understanding how threads relate to each other instead of juggling them up and down a list is helpful. This also helps you build complete product modules, instead of a cluster of incomplete products; i.e. it helps you focus on one cluster after another.

## General thoughts

- Some problems happen before or after other problems, others happen in parallel
- Some problems may have common solutions
- Not all problems are valueable to solve
- Not all problems are understandable even to the user

## General approach

- Start planar, then consolidate to linear
- Don't be afraid to have different levels of granularity but be clear on problem sizes
- Remind yourself that people are running a business (B2B) or have a life (B2C) and see where the edges of what you're solving for are
- Don't assume that a clearly identified problem means users will adopt any solution (e.g. smoking)

## Specific tactics

- Set out problem headings
- Break into subproblems
- Arrange problem clusters conceptually and also in terms of workflow
