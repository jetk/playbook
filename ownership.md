# Ownership

## When

Always, and extremely.

Or specifically, when you're blocked by something that's 'Not Your Job'

## Why

Everything is your job as product manager. Nothing stands in the way of delivering a product that solves a problem. That means:
- Nothing stands in your way of discovering what to build
- Nothing stands in your way of it being built
- Nothing stands in your way of it going to market
- Nothing stands in your way of it being measured

## General thoughts

- Ownership is always on
- Owership also applies to the strategic choices you make: at a company level, what is best
- Ownership needs to become instinctive

## General Approach

- Own an outcome, not an output
- Evaluate choices on whether they bring you closer to that outcome
- Always consider the sum totality of what needs to happen for your goal

## Specific tactics

- Always track what you're waiting for other people to do
- Drive ownerhsip in others by explaining why what they're doing is important for the product and the team they belong to
- Act autonomously, especially when there are [[two-way-doors]]
