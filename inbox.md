- What the hell is a book anyway? It's a product that solves a knowledge problem. Is a 500 page PDF really the best solution to knowing "ok, what the hell do I need to do now?" Hell no. Sure, a linear set of articles is a handy UI, but I need something I can jump around in, that makes an attempt at understanding my context. I need someone I can talk to and say "hey help I'm stuck" and it'll say "no sweat, do this". Or even something that looks at what I'm doing and pushes me "dude, you should really be thinking about that right now"
- You have a product management problem, or specifically you have a problem of not knowing who you're building for, what solution works *best* for them, how to build it and how to build a business around it. My belief is the best solution to that is me, I'm pretty sure I can solve it in a way that works for your team, I'm pretty sure that you will pay me for it.
