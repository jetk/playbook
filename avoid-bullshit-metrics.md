# Avoid Bullshit Metrics

Most metrics chosen for a product are done either after it's built or measure the wrong thing.

Net Promoter Score doesn't make sense because it's too vague: "how likely are you to reccommend McDonalds to a friend"

It's easiest to make adjustments to classic metrics, but sometimes you have to come up with something entirely new.

Make sure you have a blend of "how many times" and a way of measuring "success intensity", and make sure you have a way to sanity check these metrics.
