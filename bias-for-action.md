# Bias for Action

Learn by doing / putting things out in the world. Opposite of Analysis Paralysis.

## When

Whenever faced with situations that are not clear (most of them) and not sure which path forward is best. When you have about 80% of the information you need and you're holding off decisions until you have the other 20% which is going to take 4x the time to acquire.

## Why

The cost of inaction is guaranteed, and typically is higher than wrong action.

“If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure,” Bezos said. In other words, move fast break things.

## General thoughts

- It is better to act and adjust instead of not act
- This approach relies on building [[two way doors]]

## General approach

- Make sure your decisions are reversible as often as possible
- Validate your hunch by testing, rather than hunching more

## Specific tactics

- A/B controls
- Start off-the-shelf but ensure your interfaces allow hotswapping
